## Using this collection


This collection includes [network resource modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/network_resource_modules.html).

### Using modules from the Opengear OM collection in your playbooks

You can call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `opengear.om.om_users`.
The following example task replaces configuration changes in the existing configuration on a Opengear OM network device, using the FQCN:

```yaml
---
  - name: Replace device configuration of users.
    openear.om.om_users:
      config:
        - name: user1
          enabled: true
          no_password: true
          groups:
          - group2
      state: replaced

```
